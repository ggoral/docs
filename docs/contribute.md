## Topics List

We are always looking for guides on popular, up-and-coming hot topics, and updates to existing guides. We are also looking for:

-   [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)
-   [Game Servers](/docs/applications/game-servers/)
-   NoSQL Databases
-   [OpenChange](http://www.openchange.org/)
-   [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)

## The Submissions Process

### Write Your Article

Review the [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) before submission. We reccomend referencing it while writing to ensure that all formatting is correct. While writing, also make sure your content is:

-   **Accurate:** Your instructions should be straightforward and technically correct.
-   **Detailed:** Your content should include explanations of each step, to familiarize readers with the purpose behind each action.
-   **Formatted:** Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Guides & Tutorials [style guide](/docs/style-guide).
-   **Original:** Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

We will also review writing samples prior to full submissions, if you would like to see if your guide is in line with our requirements before taking the time to write a full guide. Writing samples can be submitted to <contribute@linode.com>.


### Submit Your Article

Submit your article as a [pull request on GitHub](/docs/github-guide), or by emailing it to <contribute@linode.com> as a plain text or Markdown file attachment. Ensure that final submissions follow the [Linode Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) guidelines. If unsure about to use GitHub to submit, please review our [GitHub Guide](/docs/github-guide), meant specifically to walk users through the GitHub submission process.

Got images and submitting through email? Attach them as **.png** or **.jpg** files. If an image is over 650 pixels wide, please send both the original and a 650-pixel-wide version.

Submission checklist:

-   Article in **.txt** or **.md** format
-   Images
-   Your name, as you want it to appear on the finished guide
-   PayPal account information, or Linode account information for Linode credit
-   *If emailing* include the title of the article in the email subject


### Post-Submission Process

Once you've submitted your article, here's what you can expect:

1.  You'll receive a brief response acknowledging your submission.
2.	If not already submitted through GitHub, most articles will be added for community review for a period of one to two weeks.
3.	After the initial one to two week period of review, your article will be accepted or rejected.
4.  If accepted, we will do a technical review of your material. This will take a few days, and you may be contacted to explain or rework steps.
5.  We will do a copy edit of the article. This will take a few days.
6.  You may receive questions or comments from us, or a request for a resubmission with a few changes.
7.  We will then send you the final version of the article before publication. You will have 36 hours to respond and approve our publication of the final version.
8.  If you respond positively (non-response will be taken as a go-ahead to publish), we will publish the article and give you the cash or Linode credit. You will be notified once the guide is live.
